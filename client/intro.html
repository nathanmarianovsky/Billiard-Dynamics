            		This website serves to provide vivid visualizations tied to the dynamics of billiards associated to an ellipse in the plane. Formally the goal is to study the trajectories an electron (or a billiard ball) traverses with different initial conditions (the position and velocity) and varying strengths of the magnetic field(s). By setting

            		and introducing the magnetic fields:
            		<div class="latex_equation">
            			$\mathbf{B} = B_\Omega(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{\hat{k}} \hspace{.3cm} \text{where} \hspace{.3cm} B_\Omega(q) = \begin{cases} B_1, & \mathbf{x} \in \Omega \\ B_2, & \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \Omega \end{cases} \hspace{.3cm} \text{with} \hspace{.3cm} B_1, B_2 \in \mathbb{R}$
            		</div>
            		we can conclude under classical mechanics that with mass $m > 0$ and charge $q > 0$ (where the sign has already been incorporated) the electron must satisfy the following law of motion govered by the Lorentz force (with no electric field):
            		<div class="latex_equation">

                    Notice if $B_i = 0$ (for $i = 1,2$) then $\mathbf{\ddot{x}} = 0$ and consequently the electron traverses along a straight line. On the other hand if we are dealing with $B_i \neq 0$ then by solving the system of differential equations above we come to see that under the influence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane an electron will traverse in circular trajectories. We also consider the possibility where $B_i = \infty$ so as to introduce a potential wall that the electron will never cross.

If it happens to be that $B_1 = 0$ or $B_1 = \infty$ then the electron's trajectory will simply be a line or a line whose intersection with $\Omega$ is missing. Thus, the only interesting scenario will occur whenever $B_1 \neq 0,\infty$.
