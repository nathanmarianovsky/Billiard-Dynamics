                    Notice if $B_i = 0$ (for $i = 1,2$) then $\mathbf{\ddot{x}} = 0$ and consequently the particle traverses along a straight line. On the other hand if we are dealing with $B_i \neq 0$ then by solving the system of differential equations above we come to see that under the influence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane an particle will traverse in circular trajectories. We also consider the possibility where $B_i = \infty$ so as to introduce a potential wall that the particle will never cross.

More specifically, the non-crossing of the boundary limits to the particle bouncing off of the boundary according to the law of reflection.

If it also happens to be that $B_1 = 0$ then the particle's trajectory will simply be a line. Thus, the only interesting scenario will occur whenever $B_1 \neq 0$ whenever $B_2 = 0$.
