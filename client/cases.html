                    Notice if $B_i = 0$ (for $i = 1,2$) then $\mathbf{\ddot{x}} = 0$ and consequently the electron traverses along a straight line. On the other hand if we are dealing with $B_i \neq 0$ then by solving the system of differential equations above we come to see that under the influence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane an electron will traverse in circular trajectories. We also consider the possibility where $B_i = \infty$ so as to introduce a potential wall that the electron will never cross.

More specifically, the non-crossing of the boundary limits to the electron bouncing off of the boundary according to the law of reflection.

                    By setting $B_2 = 0$ we ensure that the electron blows up to infinity, but at the same time we allow the electron to travel an infinite amount of time so as to come back from "the other side" when working with a projective space rather than the standard plane. If it happens to be that $B_1 = 0$ or $B_1 = \infty$ then the electron's trajectory will simply be a line or a line whose intersection with $\Omega$ is missing. Thus, the only interesting scenario will occur whenever $B_1 \neq 0,\infty$.
